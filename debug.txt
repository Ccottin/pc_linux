Find a way if input is not valid UTF-8
check with 
0 = 0 -> should we still print reduced form?

+ think about cases that 2 = 0 : that is impossible


do some hardcore parsing tests; like rolling your heand on the clavier (but only with permitted chars); or get a generator of randoms strings withs alloweds chars
try with lots of lenght
try with overflows
